👋 Hi, I’m @scooley (she/her), a product manager lead at Microsoft working on AKS on premises  
👀 I’m interested in Kubernetes, systems administration, cloud, and helping others.  
🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a good manager and run an in market product ([AKS on Azure Stack HCI + Windows Server!](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-stack/aks-hci/))  
💞️ I’m always looking for fun kubernetes applications, especially ones with a hybrid/multi cloud component.
