👋 Hi, I’m @scooley (she/her), a product manager lead at Microsoft working on AKS outside of Azure  
👀 I’m interested in Kubernetes, dev tools, systems administration, cloud, and helping others.  
🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a good manager and run an in market product ([AKS enabled by Azure Arc!](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure-stack/aks-hci/))  
💞️ I’m always looking for fun kubernetes applications to run, especially ones with an AI on the edge or IoT component.
